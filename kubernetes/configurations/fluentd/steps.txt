follow steps on: https://docs.fluentd.org/container-deployment/kubernetes


wget https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset/blob/master/fluentd-daemonset-elasticsearch.yaml

FILES ON DIRECTORY

daemonset-website-kubernetes.yaml  elastic_search.yml  elastic_search_deployment.yml

daemonset is just a demostration is not related to put elasticsearch to work on a port in external WEB

elastic_search.yml  elastic_search_deployment.yml
give us the magic thing, we have service + deployment working.

Now after that I will follw this website for logging: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/




Steps to connect with elasticsearch

Create daemonset to test connection with Elasticsearch:
	fluentd-daemonset-elasticsearch.yaml

  After:
	create service account
		cluster-service-account.yml
	create cluster role
		cluster_rol_fluentd.yml
	bind service with cluster rol:
		cluster-role-binding-fluentd.yml
