   * The InputStream is the ancestor class of all possible streams of bytes, it is not useful by itself.
   FileInputStream and other are great to deal with binary data.
   InputStreamReader and your father Reader  are used specifically to deal with characters (so strings) so they handle charset encodings (utf8, iso-8859-1, and so on) 
   If we need to deal with binary data we use InputStream  or something Like Data DataInputStream for instance.
